title: Titanic Kaggle Analysis
---

Hello to who ever is reading this! This will be my first blog ever so be warned! For my first, I chose to work with the [Titanic Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and do a straigthforward analysis with random forests after cleaning and processing it.

After importing the data, we first take a glance and look at what we are working with.

```python
temp.describe()
```
