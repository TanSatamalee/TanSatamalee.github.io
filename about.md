Hi! You can call me Tan, and I'm a data analyst near the North Hollywood area. Currently, I work as a teacher while I develop on my side analysis projects. I have a passion for data analytics and game development, and I also love to hike and manage gaming discord servers. When it comes to my work, I focus on investigating and diving deep into the data, seeing if I can find more about it that might be useful for everyone. My projects mainly focus on using Python libraries for cleaning and visualization along with any machine learning models needed, although I do have some experiences using SQL (through SQLlite) and R.
